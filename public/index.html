    <h1> My Name is Kento, and I like to shoot film.</h1>

    <p>Imagine having the time of your life with your friends whether it involved doing something stupid like zapping yourself with a bug zapper, something adventurous like climbing the peak of a mountain, or something relaxing like baking cookies with a special someone. 
      Everybody has these moments where at the time may seem special and monumental. 
      However with time, the moments become less exciting when all you have to remember them by is your memories. Photographs play a huge role in my life. 
      Growing up, my mother’s went through 3 divorces. With each divorce, my mother usually associates any memory with her ex-husbands as bad ones. I don’t find it that way however. 
      My mother used to tear up photos and throw them away as a way to move on, and I hated that. I hated that because I barely have photographs of me growing up, most ended up in the garbage somewhere in the landfill. 
      It’s sad honestly, not having any photos of your childhood. </p>
 
    <p>It became inevitable that I take up photography at some point in my life. 
      I seemed to enjoy taking photos of everything growing up, and it was not until high school where I got my first DSLR camera as a birthday gift. 
      I was really happy. I took photos of everything, literally everything. 
      Plants, my dog, my parents, my stupid anime figurines, my friends, my feet, the sky, the neighborhood, the trees, you name it. 
      I was really bad at it when I first started. I didn’t know a damn thing about exposure but I knew I loved doing it. 
      I enjoyed documenting everything I can possibly document, it followed up with a very nice feeling inside. 
      Some photos I loved, some photos I hated, but I did not stop taking photos. 
      I took my camera with me everywhere I went. To the store, to the beach, to the living room, to my friend’s house, to a party, to anywhere you can imagine. 
      It’s nice. I’ve become accustomed to being behind the camera all the time. It didn’t matter what we were doing, it was important that I document everything. </p>
    
   <p>It was bound to happen. Without proper care, it could happen to any photographers. Without money, right equipments, and ton of hard drive space, you could lose your photos. 
      At least that’s what happened to me one time. It sucked. It felt exactly like the day my mom tore up those photos and put them in the trash. 
      Except this time I couldn’t dig it out of the trash bag after sneaking it out of the dumpster when my mom went to work. What can you do?</p>

    
    <p>My life changed one day when I visited my grandparents in Japan where they gave me an old cheap film camera that still had a roll in it. 
      My grandpa told me to take it back home with me and take lots of pictures. I had no idea how to load film but I somehow figured it out. 
      I never shot on film aside from those old disposable cameras we had back in the day. Five years later, here I am shooting only on film. 
      I love it. More so than digital photography for various reasons. 
      Over the years I learned that the nature of digital images and their storage really stunts the lifespans of the images. 
      Nobody rarely looks at photos they have stored on their hard drive. At least I don’t, because there are too many of them. 
      Digital photography makes it easy to overshoot where you end up having thousands of images when technology keeps advancing with these high capacity memory cards. 
      Nowadays you can store thousands of photos on an average consumer memory card. It doesn’t work that way with film. Everything is physical and more methodical. 
      In one roll I get thirty-six photos on my 35mm Olympus OM-1 or Canon AE-1, and twelve photos on a medium format roll with my Rolleiflex. 
      I made a darkroom out of my bathroom, where I develop all of my black and white negatives. It takes about an hour to develop and process each roll. 
      Going analog has made me slow down and be more objective with all of my photos. 
      I now keep all of my negatives in a binder stored away and feel at peace that my photos are stored physically somewhere. </p>

    <p>Nowadays I don’t ever use my DSLR unless its for work. I usually use my Olympus OM-1 or my Rolleiflex for anything personal. 
      I love it so much. I take it with me everywhere I go and take pictures of literally everything. 
      There’s nothing like going home spending an hour processing the negatives to see if your photos came out. 
      Of course, it’s not always perfect. I take bad photos all the time, whether it’s underexposed, out of focus, or the photo is shaky, I love every image. 
      Mainly because of how much time and energy I spend on each of the images, documenting everything in my weird, adventurous, sometimes lame life. </p>
